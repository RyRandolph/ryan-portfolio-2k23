# Portfolio Website

## Goals:

- Banner: Front and center some photos (or Midjourney artwork) of me
- Skills section
- Work history section
- Education section
- Portfolio section (links / screenshots)
- My coding journey

## Banner:

- Idea, rotate through some images.  I’d like to see a fade out and followup image ‘grow’ only to fade out in a similar rotating fashion

## Skills:

- (pull from resume)
- Idea, make the skills view dynamic like graph ‘filling up’ to a skills rating value when it comes into view

## Work history:

- (pull from resume)
- Thinking to make this dynamic the details could perhaps show up on hover over fancy icon components

## Education:

- With honors BayBee!

## Portfolio Section:

- Since I don’t have a github at the moment, the idea is to reach back and scour the web for screenshots of my work, or screengrab from [cloud.ibm.com](http://cloud.ibm.com) , or just talk about the projects I was on.  Focus on output, not jobby stuff

## Coding Journey:

- Some of the highlights of my life with code.
    - Taught myself basic in high school before I ever had formal classes.
    - Writing my first programs with pen and paper on a road trip from oklahoma to california
- Realized I might actually be good at it when I set the curve in a class of hundreds for the intro to programming class in college. (humble brag, but its true)
- Managed to graduate with honors in computer science
- Got a job right out of high school at Big Blue!
- Lucky timing probably, they stopped hiring and started a non-stop cycle of layoffs within 2 years of my arrival… felt like I was the youngest person at IBM for 15 years
- I remember my deep frustration when I released my first bug into the wild, and to this day, probably still the worst.
- Always had a fascination with UIs, shifted to UI programming after a few years.
- I feel I changed from average young’n to seasoned professional when I read Clean Coding by Robert C Martin.  Can’t recommend this enough.  It really helped me elevate my coding to a whole new level.
- Proudest delivered function was the “Chassis Map” shipped with the Flex System Manager.  It got a lot of attention in and outside of IBM for its ability to render a visual representation of a chassis (and later a whole rack, and even later, a portion of a datacenter) complete with overlays for different types of data, like IP addresses, thermals, LED states, etc…
- Lenovo bought my division and thus began a new trajectory… team leadership.
- I’d made waves with my work, and my proudest non coding achievement was with Lenovo, when they acquired us we started incorporating FSM into Lenovo XClarity Administrator and I was the UI architect and team lead of a global team of UI developers.  We made an SPA with the now relatively primitive Dojo toolkit to dramatically improve performance over the forebarers… Quite proud of what we did , especially considering the tools we used.
    - There were reasons for dojo … it made sense at the time… :(
- As somewhat expected, Lenovo did dramatically reduce US workforce and ship it back to China, I’m kinda proud that of the couple hundred Rochester employees, over the four years I was there and the numbers steadily dwindled, I was among the last four in town.  But my number was up, and IBM took me back in what felt like a heartbeat.
- I enjoyed my time working on IBM Cloud for the next 4.5 years.  Getting spun off into a new team to again become a team lead (still global, albeit much smaller) and we built IaaS provisioning solutions using React which was a huge dev QoL improvement over the frameworks we were using at Lenovo at time.
- I’m still saddened IBM layed me off. I thought it was going to be my forever home, I’d survived so many years and IBM Cloud hadn’t had much in the way of layoffs…  A big part of my life was working for Big Blue, but now I guess new adventures await.  In the last month of being unemployed, I’ve already learned a new front end framework and some new tricks I’m quite excited about… might be my second evolution as a developer!
- New challenges await … /cheers to the future and the next parts of this story!
