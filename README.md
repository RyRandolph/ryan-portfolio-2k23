This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is my web-dev portfolio project.  My goal is to showoff myself in a creative way while also informing visitors of my capabilities.

This project is developed with a mix of strengths and new tools.  I'm a strong React / javascript developer, so I'm experimenting in this project with the capabilities of Next.js and going to try force myself to get comfortable with typescript in the project.  I was not a big fan of it last time I tried it out, making code too verbose for type safety that added little value and a few headaches.... anyway... lets see how this goes ... back to coding. 

TODO:
Change Backgrounds.
Add imagery that slides with backgrounds.  Right now its just a singluar div... but build out perhaps some other artwork or the like that slides away, or perhaps a skills mindmap type thing.




First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
